      "## Project Piku Viability Discussion:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Project Manager:** Alright team, we need to assess the viability of Project Piku. While the goal of providing AI-driven financial advice globally is ambitious, the $300 budget raises significant concerns. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Lead Developer:**  I agree. $300 wouldn't even cover the initial costs of the cloud infrastructure needed for a project of this scale, let alone the development of sophisticated AI models for technical and fundamental analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Product Manager:**  I understand the budget constraints, but we need to consider the potential market.  Financial advice is a massive industry. Even capturing a small percentage would be incredibly lucrative.  We should explore alternative funding options.\n",
      "\n",
      "**UX Designer:**  Assuming we can figure out the technical side, I'm worried about the user experience.  Financial advice needs to be accessible and understandable for everyone, regardless of their financial literacy. Designing such an intuitive platform will require extensive user research and testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Quality Assurance:**  And don't forget about regulatory compliance. Offering financial advice globally opens a huge can of worms in terms of legal requirements and security standards.  Meeting those with this budget is simply impossible. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Project Manager:**  These are all valid points. We can't compromise on quality, security, or legal compliance. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Lead Developer:**  Exactly. Even with a larger budget, building reliable AI models for financial analysis requires a huge amount of data and expertise. We would need a team of data scientists and financial analysts, which is far beyond our current resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Product Manager:** I still believe in the vision of democratizing financial advice, but I have to acknowledge the limitations.  We need to be realistic about what we can achieve with the current constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "**UX Designer:** Perhaps we could start with a smaller, more focused version of the project?  Targeting a specific niche market or offering limited features could make it more achievable. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Quality Assurance:** That’s a good point. A phased approach would allow us to validate the concept and build a solid foundation while addressing the technical and regulatory challenges incrementally.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Project Manager:**  I think we’re reaching a consensus here.  A global launch with the current resources is not viable. However,  a smaller, more focused project could be a good starting point. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Lead Developer:** I agree. We could focus on a specific geographical market and offer a limited range of AI-powered tools, gradually expanding our capabilities and reach as resources become available.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Product Manager:**  I'm onboard with that approach. It allows us to learn and adapt, validating our assumptions before committing to a larger investment. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Final Decision: Not Viable (in its current form), Pivot to a smaller, more focused project.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "While the team found the initial vision of Project Piku inspiring, the severe budget constraints and resource limitations made the global scope unfeasible. They recognized the need for robust AI development, regulatory compliance, and a user-friendly design, all of which require significant investment.  Therefore, the team unanimously decided to pivot to a more realistic and achievable version of the project, focusing on a smaller market with limited features as a starting point. This approach allows for learning, validation, and potential future expansion while minimizing risks and maximizing resource utilization. \n",
